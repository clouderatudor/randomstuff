# How we get work
## Zabbix
From time to time alerts appearing on [zabbix](https://dashboard.hwxopsrv.com/zabbix.php?action=dashboard.view). These are handled by our diligent friends who will try to find someone to "ack" it. I'm not entirely sure what "Ack" means but it definitely means the following:
1. Taking the responsibility off from the monitoring/l2 team
1. Finding out what's the actual problem
1. Fixingi it, if it's possible
1. Initiate a fix with the customer, if it's not possible
1. Tell the story to Jessica to bring it up on her meetings with the customers
1. Document the freshly learned information at TODO.
